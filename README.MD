This is a software that compares audio MD5 (Checksum). It is useful if you did a lossless conversion between 2 files, for example, converted WAV to FLAC files, or recompressed MP3 files with MP3Packer.

The software runs ffmpeg to check the audio hash.

If the hash matches between 2 files, both will be highlighted in green. Otherwise, they will be highlighted in red.
